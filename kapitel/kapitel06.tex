		% ...
		% Investigating other input types, like only depth images, would be a interesting comparison and could give more insights.
		% ...
		% It also cold be interesting to make a similar investigation towards robustness. Robustness is a import factor of a \ac{dnn}, especially in sensitive fields, like autonomous driving, where new factors like new light settings happens all the time and live could depend on the robustness of a \ac{dnn}.
