	\section{Objective and Importance}
	\label{sec:objective-and-importance}
		Since introducing instance segmentation in the years 2012-2014 \cite{Yang2012}\cite{Silbermann2012}\cite{Hariharan2014}, it has become one of the most important and complex tasks in computer vision \cite{Sharma2022}. \\
		Detecting and separating every object in an image can be found in many modern responsibilities. It ranges from grading prostate cancer \cite{Hassan2022}, to understanding cell division, cellular growth, and morphogenesis \cite{Kar2022}, to wildlife monitoring \cite{Haucke2021}, to segmenting unknown marine objects \cite{Hu2024}, to tooth segmentation in dental medicine \cite{Brahmi2023} and much more. The rising use cases also create a need for more precise segmentations. It can be challenging to achieve this goal because many factors, like the domain, data quality, quantity, \ac{dnn} architecture, and data augmentations, can be adjusted.\\
		For example, it is still being determined if the input images should be provided as RGB with depth or as only depth or RGB. First, it seems straightforward that depth is important and helpful information for segmentation, and it showed promising results in many cases \cite{Danielczuk2019}\cite{Xie2021}. However, recent research shows that RGB-only images as input, for instance segmentation, can achieve even better results \cite{Raj2023}. It doesn't seem very clear and leads to the question of which factors matter for precise generalization and whether depth data could improve this success even more.\\
		In addition, there are common difficulties in the field of instance segmentation, such as clutter environments with overlapping objects (also called occlusion), novel objects, and challenging materials like translucent or reflective ones.\\
		There also needs to be more clarity about the shape-texture bias in \ac{cnn}-based approaches. Some research suggests a bias towards texture as rewarding \cite{Qiu2024} while others recommend a shape-bias \cite{Geihors2019} and also a debiased approach can be successful in some scenarios \cite{Li2021}\cite{Co2021}\cite{Chung2023}. In turn, research shows that a bias alone cannot be the reason for a good or bad performance \cite{Gavrikov2024}. It is essential to notice that some factors of these researches vary, like sometimes the focus is on classification, sometimes on \ac{ood} data, but the current state of research still seems to be confusing and have a gap of research and clearness.\\
		Besides generalization optimization and the influence of bias, there is often the transfer from simulation to the real world. The need for simulations exists due to the data quantity that every \ac{dnn} requires to perform precisely and accurately \cite {Uchida2016}\cite{Alzubaidi2021}\cite{Csurka2023}. Labeling segmentation data is always very time-consuming and costly since every pixel must be labeled. To solve this challenge, using a virtual environment with automatic labeling is much cheaper and faster. However, there is a gap between the synthetic and real-world data. How to bridge from simulation to the real world still remains a problem of research \cite{Doersch2019}.\\
		Lastly, there is not enough qualitative research about the influence of the quantity of different shapes and textures on instance segmentation.\\
		\\
		\textbf{To conclude}, more research needs to be done on shape-texture bias in instance segmentation, and the existing research needs to be more precise and also in context with generalization. Consequently, it is crucial to continue research on generalization, bias, sim-to-real, depth-data, and shape-texture quantity to improve the performance of instance segmentation.
		
	
	
	\section{Core Focus of the Study}    % Research Gap and 
	\label{sec:core-focus-of-the-study}
		Generalization, shape-texture bias, and sim-to-real transfer are all fundamental and complex areas with many research possibilities. This study will focus on depth data and the quantity of shapes and textures in relation to these three areas. A practical approach to uncovering new and valuable insights is the main objective of this study.\\
		Understanding the impact of depth data on shape-texture bias, generalization, and sim-to-real performance of a \ac{dnn} is essential. Collecting depth data in real-world scenarios can be challenging, so knowing how much depth data enhances segmentation outcomes can be highly beneficial.\\
		Additionally, new information about the influence of shape-texture quantity could be relevant and valuable. Generating different shapes and textures with high quality and quantity, potentially in a domain-specific manner, is demanding and time-intensive. Determining the minimum necessary variety of shapes and textures for robust generalization can support the efficiency of \ac{dnn} development for instance-segmentation.\\
		\\
		An uncovered inspection is the combination of depth data and shape-texture quantity on generalization, shape-texture bias, and sim-to-real transfer, which could yield interesting insights.
		
	
	
	\section{Methodology Overview}
	\label{sec:methodology-overview}
		This work trained 18 different Mask R-CNN \cite{Kaiming2017} models on synthetic, in unreal engine \cite{Romero2022} created datasets, each with 20.000 RGB-, depth- and mask-images. The different shapes and textures vary between the datasets. Also, the models can only have RGB or RGB-depth as input data.\\
		With these 18 \ac{dnn}s, three different studies were performed for generalization, shape-texture bias, and sim-to-real transfer.\\
		A few outlier data shows, if the \ac{dnn} learned to prefer shape or texture.\\
		A small Test dataset with a structured combination of novel and known shapes and textures is proposed to test the generalization of shape and texture.\\
		Finally, an existing real-world dataset, for instance segmentation, is used to see the sim-to-real performance.
		
	
	
	\section{Scope and Delimitations}
	\label{sec:scope-and-delimitations}
		Investigating generalization, shape-texture bias, and sim-to-real transfer with a focus on depth data and shape-texture quantity must come with reduced scope and delimitations. Otherwise, it would be an excess of work. Furthermore, some delimitation is needed, thus keeping the influencing factors as small as possible.\\
		First, only Mask R-CNN \cite{Kaiming2017} is used as \ac{dnn} because many assumptions are made on top of research for \ac{cnn}-based approaches.\\
		Moreover, all used \ac{dnn}s are trained on the same type of datasets, where only the objects' shape, texture, and position vary.\\
		Both named delimitations are important in excluding influences with certainty. Another \ac{dnn} architecture can differ in bias, accuracy, and learning. Mask R-CNN's wide range of use, distribution, and flexibility made it a good choice as \ac{dnn} for this study.\\
		For the same reason, every \ac{dnn} used the same hyper-parameters for training. Even if there are better parameters, these parameters must be consistently equal during the studies to eliminate a possible influence.\\
		This work focuses primarily on instance segmentation for bin-picking. Which is a common task of instance segmentation and important for automation\cite{Raj2023}\cite{Danielczuk2019}\cite{Xie2021}. However, the research should be valid and vital for every instance of the segmentation approach.\\
		Another delimitation is the choice of different shapes and textures. The difference is difficult to measure. There are some methods, like the structural similarity index measure \cite{Wang2004}, but it is not a standard approach. In the end, a subjective choice was applied due to some misclassifications using objective methods.
		\\
		Due to the amount of studies and time limitations, a limited test-data size is given.\\
		This study can find indications and chances, while an underlying truth cannot be provided. Again, this is owed to the complexity and dimension of this research.\\
		Also, due to time limitations, a suboptimal number of epochs was chosen. More epochs would lead to even better results, but the experiments should not be influenced by the extra precision; still, it is a limitation.
		Next up, the number of different shapes and textures used is limited to a maximum of 160. The rare availability of high-quality shapes and textures justifies this.\\
		The usage of depth information also comes with delimitations. There are many ways to use depth information, as described in section \ref{sec:state-of-the-art}, but this study can only approach one way to use depth, or else the amount of \ac{dnn} and training would rise too vast. This study uses the straightforward approach of adding a fourth channel with depth information.\\
		Synthetic data often comes with quality issues, and this work's proposed datasets are not different. There are some major downsides which should be considered. The render quality should be higher than it is because of the method used to render and save. The spawning objects can also spawn into each other, sometimes leading to unfavorable data. \\
		Lastly, this study needs to meet the assumption that it will not find novel knowledge. This study tries to reinforce or question current state-of-the-art research to find practical results. In a broader context, that could provide valuable insights. A profound look is not possible through the wide research question.
	
	
	
	\section{Key Definitions}
	\label{sec:key-definitions}
	
		Here are some important definitions for this work to make a clear point and prevent misunderstandings.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Instance Segmentation:} Instance Segmentation is the task of finding and labeling every foreground object in an image pixel-wise. The classification of these objects is optional and plays no role in the segmentation.\\
		\textbf{Bin Picking:} During bin picking, a robot tries to grasp an object from a bin and uses or transports it to another place. Instance Segmentation is needed in bin picking to find all available objects in the bin.\\
		\textbf{Texture:} Texture is an object's visual appearance and pattern. This word is significant. Thus, it is part of the investigation. An object can have the texture of a rock, water, salt, skin, piece of wood, steel beam, and much more. A texture is local information. It describes specific areas on a detailed level and does not describe the overall shape of an object.\\
		\textbf{Material:} A material describes the physical properties of an object, like color, metalness, roughness, and the height of the surface. If a picture is taken of an object that has a material, on the picture, the texture of the object is visible, which is defined by its material. The properties of a material can be described as single number values or, for more complexity, as a bump map (image).\\
		\textbf{Shape:} A Shape defines the geometry of an object. It is also often referred to as mesh or 3D-model. Simple shapes are spheres and rectangles. A shape is global information. It defines the boundaries of an object and is only available in the broader view.\\
		\textbf{Depth data:} As depth mentioned, data are images that contain information about the distance from every object. The images have only one channel. Every pixel value states how far or near the given pixel in reality to the camera was/is.\\
		\textbf{Novel Objects:} Novel objects are objects that were not part of the \ac{dnn}'s training. Novel objects are a typical challenge for bin-picking since there are often unique and innovative products in production and automation pipelines.\\
		\textbf{Out of distribution data:} Data which differs essentially from the train data of a \ac{dnn}. A new domain with a completely different background, resolution, quality, and quantity is a \ac{ood} data.\\
		\textbf{Generalization:}The \ac{dnn}'s ability to generalize defines how well it learns the underlying task and patterns of the train data. Shape- or texture-generalization, in instance segmentation specifically, is the ability to learn to segment objects with their shape or texture, even if they are novel to the \ac{dnn}. Meaning that the network learned how to extract shape or texture and detect object boundaries with this information. \\
		\textbf{Bias:} A bias shows a preferred, learned strategy to solve a task. It is most likely caused by the train data itself but also influenced by the \ac{dnn} architecture. A shape- or texture bias is present when the \ac{dnn} prefers the global shape information or the local texture information to make mask predictions.\\
		\textbf{Sim-to-real:} Sim-to-real is the transfer from synthetic train data to the real world. Synthetic data is used through its cheap and fast production and the challenging collection of labeled real data. The quality of synthetic data fluctuates but is always much less complex than the natural world and does not reproduce reality precisely enough, thus causing a gap. The goal is that the \ac{dnn} generalize well enough to bridge this sim-to-real gap.\\
		\textbf{Occlusions:} If only a part of an object is visible thus another object lays on top, it called occlusion. Occlusion is a common problem in clutter scenes, appearing often in instance segmentation.
