	Diskussion - Bias Experiment: In the bias experiment it is difficult to say if a prediction is biased towards texture or shape. All confusing data is only confusing on texture level, so a texture biased model should perform poorly in comparison to a shape biased model. But also a shape biased model will use texture information and the question is how much and how the impact really is. In addition there are other influences, like amount of objects per scene, brightness, reflective texture, novel texture, novel shape and all of these can influence the result. -> my opinion? what does the results look like?
	It seems like that there are learned shape and texture dependent decisions
