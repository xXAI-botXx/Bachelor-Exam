\chapter{Inference Examples on Optonic Bin-Picking Dataset}
\label{appendix:inference-examples}
	Three example inferences on the Optonic Bin-Picking Dataset are provided in this appendix using a model trained 40 epochs on only synthetic RGB train data (3xM Dataset) with 160 shapes and 160 textures.\\
	A training on the real data could quickly lead to precise results without the frequently occurring artifacts, detected in the background of the scene and could also improve the performance with cluttered objects.
